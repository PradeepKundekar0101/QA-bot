 * flickering back and forth as the loop turns. A stage nothing ever entered reads as
 * `not_started` while the run is alive and `not_run` once it is over - a failed run must
 * not leave three screens claiming they are still waiting their turn.
 *
 * `status` matters as well as the stream because a run whose process was killed never got
 * to emit `done`: its events just stop. Without the record's own verdict, an interrupted
 * run would sit there promising work that nothing is left to do.
